# Disappear

A project makes anything disappear in your image/video, combines with Meta's SAM.

> üõ†Ô∏è‚ò£Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Work in progress.

Think that you just need typing `make the dogs in image gone`, and then the dogs in your image are completely gone. This now can be done along with SAM!


However, this seems not easy to integrate, we will implement it in 3 phases:

- **step 1**: Remove humans in video;
- **step 2**: integrate SAM models;
- **step 3**: SAM + Inpainting;


Here are some result:
